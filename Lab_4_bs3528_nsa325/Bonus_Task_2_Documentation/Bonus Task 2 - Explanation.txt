The new instruction we added is called "BADD" and it stands for Big Add.

We were inspired by a problem we encountered while writing the instructions
for our "Fibonacci Counter" program for Task 4. 

Since instructions accept signed operands, the biggest number that we could 
add in one instruction was 31 (011111). However, we wanted to add a bigger 
number in one instruction without worrying about the sign bit and increasing
the performance of our code. 

So, we developed "BADD" instruction to add bigger numbers by utilizing all 
of the 6 bits. Whenever you need to add more than 31 in one instruction, 
you can call "BADD" and enter a 6 digit unsigned number and "BADD" 
instruction will take care of the rest.
