Q1. Is the FSM a Mealy machine or a Moore machine?

A1: The FSM is a Moore machine since the output is not a function of the inputs. 
The state diagram confirms this as the arcs do not show an output along with the input.

Q2. Can we declare our own custom data types in VHDL? Give an example.

A2: Yes, we can declare our own custom data types in VHDL, as in other low-level languages. 
We defined a data type for this exercise, state_type, in the architecture. See below:

"type state_type is (IDLE, L1, L2, L3, R1, R2, R3, LR3);"

Q3. Explain the significance of having three different processes? Is it necessary to
have exactly three processes to model FSMs? Can we use only two or one?

A3: The benefit of having distinct processes is that all processes occur concurrently. 
Otherwise, within a process, statements are executed sequentially. If
everything were to be lumped in a single process, the clock divider signal, for example,
would have to wait for other actions to be processed, as well as, look for the rising edge
of the clock to carry out its action. This would mean it could miss clock edges and 
interfere with other processes that it should be actively listening for rather than 
carrying out the action for after the process occurs.
